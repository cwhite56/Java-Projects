# Brute Force Password Cracker

## Overview
For my final CS1181 project I was tasked with utilizing threads to crack into a password protected zip file. There are two difficult levels. protected3.zip and protected5.zip. These files have a 3 lowercase letter password and 5 lowercase letter password respectively.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn to chain threads together to work on a larger task as well as using recursion to generate all possible passwords.
## Usage
This program will no longer run unfortunately. I was given starter code that imported methods to test passwords on the zip files. This starter code broke and I haven't been able to figure out how to integrate them again.
