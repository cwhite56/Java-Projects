# Package Delivery Optimization

## Overview
The third project in the course required me design a discrete event simulator. The scenario involved a factory delivering a certain number of packages by truck and drone. The trucks were routinely stopped by a train. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use discrete simulation to find the optimal spread of packages delivered by truck and by train. 
## Usage
The only change that should be made is the percentage by drone. Upon running, the simulator will output the various truck and train events until all packages have been delivered.
