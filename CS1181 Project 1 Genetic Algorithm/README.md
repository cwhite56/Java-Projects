# Genetic Algorithm

## Overview
The first project from CS1181 was based on the Knapsack problem. Given a set of items with varying weights and values, what are the best items to include under the weight limit. Rather than finding the best items, this program finds the fittest chromosome across many generations. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to dial in on OOP principals. After the standard dungeon crawler, this project was my first usage of main OOP ideas. 
## Usage
The main for loop is set to run 20 times. This simulates 20 generations of chromosomes with a random amount of mutation. Upon running, the algorithm will output the fittest chromosome and its list of included items.
